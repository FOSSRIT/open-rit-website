{% comment %}
The aside element creates a small floating element that sits on the right of the page in a
little orange box.  It sits apart from the main content of the page, as not to disrupt
the reading experience.  This is used, for example, to create a small list of quick links
on the page.

Arguments:
  content: The markdown content to be placed in the aside
{% endcomment %}

<div class="aside">
	{{ include.content | markdownify }}
