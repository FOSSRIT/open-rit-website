## Results

When Dr. Osier came to Open@RIT, his main concern was understanding university policy related to IP ownership of research software. He wanted to ensure his project was in compliance with university policy. Our consultation allowed him to easily and confidently release his software according to best practices and streamline this process for future faculty through the creation of document templates regarding IP release approval.
