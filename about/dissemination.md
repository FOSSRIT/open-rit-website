  questions:
  - question: What are the project’s goals?
    answer: >
      Why is this project being undertaken, and more importantly, what will it
      acheive? How do you determine if this project is a success? It is also
      helpful to review the target applications of the project, who it will
      impact, or what specific operating procedures the work sector requires.
      The purpose of this question is to get a sort of “check list” of items
      that we can evaluate our assistance against. It helps us to better
      understand the purpose the community will play in accomplishing the goals
      set out by the project (and what new goals they may bring).
  - question: Why do you want this project to be open source?
    answer: >
      Are you looking to increase your peer group to allow for more review?
      Are you trying to share your work to allow others the opportunity to
      build on it independent of you? Are you trying to expand your partnership
      with the private sector or other universities? The freedom allowed by
      open source licensing can protect the university from liability when you
      work open source. Moving into the open can be daunting, but we exist to
      help facilitate that development.
  - question: What sort of community are you trying to build?
    answer: >
      Open Academia is distinct from the conventional academic world in that
      ownership & coordination happens on a per-project level.  Communities
      formed around projects are the key drivers of change instead of
      institutions. These communities have a variety of governance structures
      and demographics. Some are close-knit and homogenious, others are broad,
      federated, and heterogenious.  Understanding who your ideal community is
      made up of is integral to planning on putting yours together.
  - question: How is the community currently contributing?
    answer: >
      A community supported project is only as strong as the system in place to
      support said project. As such, considerations must be taken to make the
      contribution process as smooth as possible. Do contributors come through
      word of mouth?  Are their contributions supported by some sort of
      organization? Or are they handpicked from applicants to supply
      information and contributions to further the project? Understanding the
      process of contribution for each type of community member is necessary to
      make that process effective. It also helps us to contrast their current
      contribution methods with ideal or planned methodology, and work to get
      the two as close as possible.
who:
  title: Who does this affect?
  deets: >
    The contributor experience is extremely important to the overall success of
    an Open project. When identifying sorespots in the contributor pathway we
    will clarify with questions such as:
  image:
    url: /assets/images/pages/playbook/question-mark-2.svg
    alt: An arm holding a question mark like a ball
  questions:
  - question: Who are the stakeholders and contributors?
    answer: >
      Anyone involved in the project is a **stakeholder**, our clients, their
      funding agencies, anyone contributing to the project. Ultimately, those
      governing the project should be accountable to all stakeholders involved.
      Defining stakeholders is key to understanding who is involved, their
      needs/wants, and how to effectively govern your project.


      Anyone that adds something to the project is considered a
      **contributor**, even for the slightest changes or recommendations. They
      could be posting on a forum, submitting bug reports, building the
      website, building the roadmap, supporting users, and troubleshooting the
      code. The only people who in a community who aren’t contributors are the
      people who never change anything and simply observe.


      Those **users** are still important as they are beneficiaries of the open
      project as a whole, being as entitled to the benefits as anyone else.
  - question: How do you attract contributors?
    answer: >
      Another way of posing this question is to ask “why do people want to
      contribute to this?” What is the specific reason why someone would want
      to provide input, data points, contribute to research, or contribute
      their valuable time to your project. This will also help you better
      understand them, your most valuable stakeholders.


      From the outset, assume contributors want to contribute. What must be
      done is to make individuals who would wish to be contributors aware of
      the project, and more importantly, aware of what they can do to share
      their own contributions. Make it easy to do so, with as simple a process
      as possible.
  - question: What is the ideal contributor pathway?
    answer: >
      For each of your defined stakeholders, how would you imagine them
      becoming a contributor? How would they find the project? What sort of
      contribution would they make? What would that process look like? Would
      they make a second/third contribution? Why? Would they take further
      responsibilities and leadership roles? What would that process look like?


      These pathways are to serve as a baseline for our community development
      strategy.
  - question: Where are the gaps in the contributor pathways?
    answer: >
      For the ideal pathways theorized in our previous question, how does that
      differ from the experience of contributors you’ve interacted with so far?
      What roadblocks or issues have prevented those theoretical pathways from
      being completed?

      By identifying the points of failure in the contributor pathway, you can
      begin ideating solutions to those failures.
  - question: What are the project’s goals?
    answer: >
      Why is this project being undertaken, and more importantly, what will it
      acheive? How do you determine if this project is a success? It is also
      helpful to review the target applications of the project, who it will
      impact, or what specific operating procedures the work sector requires.
      The purpose of this question is to get a sort of “check list” of items
      that we can evaluate our assistance against. It helps us to better
      understand the purpose the community will play in accomplishing the goals
      set out by the project (and what new goals they may bring).
how:
  title: How can we help?
  deets: >
    Here’s where the rubber hits the road, our section of ideation and development. With client input we determine what we can undertake to: improve experience, increase contributor retention, and reduce the overall workload of community management. This may include:

    alt: A magnifying glass investigating a question mark
  questions:
  - question: Project Documentation
    answer: >
      Perhaps the project leads are being contacted for assistance often, and
      it’s taking time away from their project. Or perhaps potential
      contributors are washing out of the project due to an onboarding process
      that is either non-existant or more difficult than necessary. We offer
      support in creating or improving existing project documentation, for
      onboarding, technical support, and industry integration.
  - question: Inbound Materials
    answer: >
      When project contributors vanish into the depths of a half maintained
      website, never to return, we offer assistance in developing community
      landing pages, or better optimizing existing pages, critiqued and
      re-envisioned by our UI/UX designers for the tasks required.
  - question: Feedback Assistance
    answer: >
      We also provide assistance with feedback systems to better understand the
      state of the community within each project. It might be assistance with
      GitHub, community analytics through our analytics platform Mystic, or
      deliberate feedback from our design team on points to improve on the
      project platforms themselves.
  - question: Outreach & Networking Strategies
    answer: >
      Finally, we can help our clients develop outreach and networking
      strategies, so that their community can reach more potential users.

## Our Playbook

Half consultancy, half accellerator, our expertise lies in the development of the support community surrounding an Open Source project. In an ideal world everyone who could ever use or contribute to this project will know about it, undestand it, and have access to it. We seek to streamline the contriubtion process, improve outreach, and provide support to projects getting ready for take-off.

To this end, we have structured our process around a three part checklist of questions developed to best understand the scope of the project and where we fit in.
