## Open@RIT Fellows

Open@RIT received a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to [support the Open Programs Office][1] and to create a LibreCorps team dedicated to expanding the use of RIT Faculty and Staff Open Work and Communities. The Open@RIT Fellows Program awards the services of that team to provide consultation and services to our Fellows dedicated to the creation or expansion of contributor communities around their projects. Open@RIT believes that this work can enhance the visibility, impact, and translation of our Fellowsâ€™ efforts. Our second Call for Proposals finished in the end of 2021 but stay tuned for further CFPs.
