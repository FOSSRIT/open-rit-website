## Open@RIT Town Hall #1 Enhancing Grant Proposals with Open Community Plans

As part of our ongoing effort to cultivate the University’s Open community, Open@RIT is hosting a series of three, monthly town halls this spring semester.

In this session, we'll discuss how Open Community plans enhance a grant proposal's viability amid the current push towards Open Work in Academia.
In the last six months we’ve seen significant support for Open Work from the federal government.

 * Memos from The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a new guidance requiring public access to all federally funded research across the arts, sciences and humanities and declaring 2023 The Year of Open Science.
 * Despite the term “Science” the National Endowment for the Humanities is also listed in the second memo and its just the tip of the iceberg :-)
 * 18 months ago, RIT joined The National Academy of Sciences’ Higher Education Leadership Initiative in Open Scholarship (HELIOS) as per the President and the Provost. This
 * 80+ member initiative brings together presidential appointees into working groups on suggestions for evolving Academia to be more Open.
 * Philanthropic funders are following suit.

## [Zotero Collection on Open Work&nbsp;>](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2725709/rit_open_work_resources/library)

For those interested in learning more about open source and Open Work, we’ve compiled our online public collection of references and resources on Zotero. Browse through a variety of articles, essays, and more that we’ve collected, plenty to provide both introductions and in-depth explanations about specialized open topics.

We try to refresh this at least three times a year, subscribe to our RSS feed or mailing list to be updated when new content is added.

## [Intro to Owning Your IP - Lecture Slides&nbsp;>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CjEuAbjLJ5wOwH3QsXVpRAibrdJ_4Bqa/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106655582639956727911&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Introducing open work to students is a great way to create new open communities. To help with that, we have created a quick slideshow lecture designed to familiarize RIT students with owning their IP in general and ways to learn more and get involved at RIT.  The last several slides have been organized by college to make it easy for you to customize it so download it and modify it to your heart’s content.
