## Projects By Our Fellows

Since January 2021, our team has been working with faculty who have applied to our Open@RIT fellowship program for assistance developing communities around their Open Work. Our interdisciplinary LibreCorps team of designers, technical writers, developers, and social media managers assisted in designing more effective pipelines for contribution. Our work often resulted in sustainability plans that our fellows utilized in further grant funding applications to grow and sustain their research.
