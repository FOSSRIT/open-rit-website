## Why Now?

The time is ripe to look at Open practices across communities to \n compare, contrast, and cross-pollinate best practices in Open \n across different communities.

- **The National Science Foundation** is soliciting proposals for funding to support “Open Source Ecosystems” to improve sustainability, impact, and translation of “open source research products.”

- **The National Institutes of Health** has released new policy to improve and refine the sharing of, and collaboration around, research data.

- **The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)** have issued a tool kit to improve and encourage university support of Open Scholarship.

- **Across the European Union**, the creation of national policies on Open Science and Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) for Government is accelerating.

- **A handful of universities have created OSPOs to utilize techniques pioneered in private industry to better facilitate academic Open Work.**
